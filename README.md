# JavaScript with DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Roadmap

to help you build strong foundations in both JavaScript and problem-solving skills:

## 1. Learn the Basics of JavaScript

Before diving into DSA, ensure a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

### Topics to Cover:

> Syntax and Basics:

> Variables (var, let, const)

> Data Types (Strings, Numbers, Booleans, etc.)

> Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Comparison)

> Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)

> Loops (for, while, do-while)

> Functions:

> Function Declaration and Expression

> Arrow Functions

> Callback Functions

> Objects and Arrays:

> Object Properties and Methods

> Array Methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach)

> ES6+ Features:

> Template Literals

> Destructuring

> Spread and Rest Operators

> Promises and Async/Await

## 2. Understand Big O Notation
Big O notation is essential to evaluate the time and space complexity of algorithms.

### Topics to Cover:

What is Big O?
Common Complexities:
O(1) - Constant Time
O(log n) - Logarithmic Time
O(n) - Linear Time
O(n²) - Quadratic Time
Space Complexity Analysis

Stacks and Queues

Implement using arrays or linked lists
Applications: Balanced Parentheses, Min Stack
Linked Lists

Singly and Doubly Linked Lists
Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Reversal

4. Master Important Algorithms
Learn the fundamental algorithms used in solving problems efficiently.

Algorithm Categories:
Sorting Algorithms:

5. Practice Problem-Solving
Start solving problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codewars, or GeeksforGeeks.

Steps to Practice:
Start with easy problems (arrays, strings, simple loops).
Gradually move to medium problems (sliding window, recursion).
Take on hard problems once confident.
Focus on:
Optimization of time and space.
Understanding edge cases.
6. Projects to Reinforce DSA with JavaScript
Apply DSA concepts in practical projects to solidify your understanding.

Suggested Projects:
Task Manager with Priority Queue
Use heaps or a custom priority queue.
Autocomplete Feature
Use Tries for prefix searching.
Social Network Graph
Represent connections using graphs and implement BFS/DFS.
File Organizer
Apply sorting algorithms and hash maps.
7. Explore Advanced Topics (Optional)
Once you’re confident, explore:

Functional Programming in JavaScript.
Web Development Algorithms (e.g., DOM Manipulation Optimization).
Concurrency Models (Event Loop, Async/Await).
